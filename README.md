# A ml like language that implements a bidirectional typechecker

This is the implementation of "Bidirectional Typing Rules: A Tutorial" by David Raymond Christiansen. 

My first real project in haskell. The tokenizer is made with parsec and the parser itself is made with Earley. Couldn't find any other good examples of Earley code so I hope this may serve a simple example for it.

It's only meant to be a typechecker, it does not interpret code.

There is a branch for a just parsec parser. I've been playing around it.
